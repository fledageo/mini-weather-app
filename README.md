This project is a small React weather application that allows users to search for weather information for different cities. The app provides a user-friendly interface to input city names, fetch and display current weather conditions, and view weather icons based on the conditions. It leverages geolocation to fetch weather data for the user's current location as well.

## Key Features:

### Search Weather by City:
Users can input the name of a city in a search bar. The app provides suggestions from a dropdown list of city names as the user types. Users can select a city from the dropdown to fetch and display its weather information.

### View Weather Information:
After selecting a city, the app retrieves and displays the current weather for that city, including temperature and a corresponding weather icon.

### Use Geolocation:
If no city is selected, the app uses the user's geolocation to fetch and display weather information for their current location.

### Weather Icons:
The app uses various icons to represent different weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy weather.
